            <pre>
                
[Refrain]
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad

[Verse 1]
I, I can't get these memories out of my mind
And some kind of madness has started to evolve, mmm
And I, I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah

[Bridge 1]
I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized what you mean

[Verse 2]
And now I need to know - is this real love
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat? mmm
And when I look back at all the crazy fights we've had
Like some kind of madness was taking control, yeah

[Bridge 2]
And now I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized what you need
[Verse 3]
But now I have finally seen the end
(finally seen the end)
And I'm not expecting you to care, no
(expecting you to care)
That I have finally seen the light
(finally seen the light)
And I have finally realized
(realized)
I need to love
I need to love

[Outro]
Come to me, just in a dream
Come on and rescue me
Yes I know I can be wrong
Baby, you're too headstrong
Our love is...

Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma--ma--ma madness...
